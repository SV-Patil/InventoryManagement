##  USE
The ultimate need of this inventory management application is to make a transition from old concept of 'writing everything on paper' to 'Digital register'.<br/>
This application can help store owner to efficiently manage the data without handling the pile of registers. Since price of each medicine is already stored in app, the efforts needed to manually enter the mrp and then calculate the total is reduced. The visualization of revenue can differentiate between high profit medicines and frequently purchased medicines, which results in better inventory plan.
